# BabylonJS Scene - Third Person Character Controller

This repository stores the BabylonJS Scene ```Third Person Character Controller```.

It is being referenced from [BabylonJS Third Person Character Controller](https://github.com/vanHeemstraSystems/babylonjs-third-person-character-controller).

The idea is to seperate the *scenes* from the *framework* that uses these scenes, so one can develop scenes separately and independently from the framework.
