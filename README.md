# BabylonJS Scene - Third Person Character Controller

This repository stores the BabylonJS Scene ```Third Person Character Controller```.

It is being referenced from [BabylonJS Third Person Character Controller](https://github.com/vanHeemstraSystems/babylonjs-third-person-character-controller).

The idea is to seperate the *scenes* from the *framework* that uses these scenes, so one can develop scenes separately and independently from the framework.

Take into account "Optimizing a Large-Scale Babylon.js Scene" at https://joepavitt.medium.com/optimizing-a-large-scale-babylon-js-scene-9466bb715e15 and "Optimizing Your Scene" at https://doc.babylonjs.com/features/featuresDeepDive/scene/optimize_your_scene

See an example of a very large scene at https://www.ibm.com/resources/cloud/mayflower-ship-experience/#/experience/harbor and how it was built at https://joepavitt.medium.com/building-the-web-based-3d-digital-experience-for-the-mayflower-autonomous-ship-a56f08e6558
